    "desc": "Venus is almost the same size as Earth (0.815 Earth masses). Venus is also in many other ways similar to Earth, as it has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a significant atmosphere, and likely geological activity. However, there are significant differences; Venus is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is almost 90 times denser. Venus has no natural satellites and is the hottest planet in the solar system with a surface temperature of over 400 Â°C. The high temperature is mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. There is no definitive evidence that Venus is currently geologically active, but it lacks a magnetic field that would prevent the atmosphere from escaping into space. This may indicate that the atmosphere is regularly replenished by volcanic eruptions. The atmosphere is very thick and consists mostly of carbon dioxide. Venus is also known as the Evening Star or Morning Star because, depending on its phase, it can be seen from Earth with the naked eye either in the evening or morning. Between phases, Venus comes too close to the Sun and cannot be seen from Earth.",
